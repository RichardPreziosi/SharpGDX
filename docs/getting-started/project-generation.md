Before diving into the APIs provided by SharpGDX, let’s create a very simple “game”, that touches each module provided by the framework, to get a feeling for things. We’ll introduce a few different concepts without going into unnecessary detail.

In the following, we'll look at:

  * Basic file access
  * Clearing the screen
  * Drawing images
  * Using a camera
  * Basic input processing
  * Playing sound effects

  ## Project Setup
Follow the steps in the [Generating a Project](/getting-started/project-generation) guide. In the following, we will use these settings:

  * Application name: `drop`
  * Package name: `com.badlogic.drop`
  * Game class: `Drop`
