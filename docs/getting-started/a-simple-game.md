Before diving into the APIs provided by SharpGDX, let’s create a very simple “game”, that touches each module provided by the framework, to get a feeling for things. We’ll introduce a few different concepts without going into unnecessary detail.

In the following, we'll look at:

  * Basic file access
  * Clearing the screen
  * Drawing images
  * Using a camera
  * Basic input processing
  * Playing sound effects

  ## Project Setup
Follow the steps in the [Generating a Project](/getting-started/project-generation) guide. In the following, we will use these settings:

  * Application name: `Drop`
  * Game class: `Drop`

 To launch or debug the game, see the page [Importing & Running a Project](/getting-start/running).

If we just run the project, we will get an error: `Couldn't load file: badlogic.jpg`. Your Run Configuration has to be properly configured first: Select as working directory `PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT/​drop/assets`. In addition, if you are working on macOS, be sure to either add the ([experimental](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aglfw-awt-macos)) `com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-lwjgl3-glfw-awt-macos` dependency to your desktop project or set the VM Options to `-XstartOnFirstThread`. When we run the game now, we will get the default 'game' generated by the setup app: a Badlogic Games image on a red background. Not too exciting, but that’s about to change.
